# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

## I'm AgustÃ­n Ruiz, a product designer living in Mar del Plata, Argentina.

**I love helping elevate companies' design teams and make them more successful.**

During my 14+ years of experience, I've worn all sorts of design hats: packaging, branding, development, editorial, and a long list of etceteras. For the last 7 years or so, I've focused mainly on UX/UI and product design, and came to love evolving digital products. 

I'm currently working as Product Designer for a privacy operations company based out of Washington, as part of the [SCVSoft](https://scvsoft.com/) team.
