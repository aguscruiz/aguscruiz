# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

## Iâ€™m AgustÃ­n Ruiz, a UX/UI designer and front-end developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Hi! Iâ€™m AgustÃ­n and Iâ€™m an interface designer and front-end developer. In my 13+ years of experience Iâ€™ve worked both as a freelancer and employed at design agencies, and currently as a product designer for an Internet of things company.

Iâ€™m passionate about creating simple experiences, focused on the user, but with a great visual quality. Being pixel-perfect-obsessed, I came to learn about development in order to help make sure that designs are as perfect as they can be. This led me to collaborate closely with developers in every step of a project.

My main area of expertise is UI design, but I also work with UX, front-end development, branding and UX writing. 

Iâ€™m currently working as designer/developer at [Avi-on Labs](https://avi-on.com/) and [SCVSoft](https://scvsoft.com/).
